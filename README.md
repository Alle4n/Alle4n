## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with a strong background in data analysis, research, and monitoring & evaluation. I thrive at the intersection of analytical thinking and creative web development, building user-friendly, responsive, and accessible web interfaces.

Over the last decade, I've mastered data management, visualization, and evidence-based systems in research contexts. My curiosity for digital user experience led me to transition into frontend development, and I've since built a portfolio using modern frameworks and tools.
